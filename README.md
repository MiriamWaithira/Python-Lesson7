# Python Libraries Overview

This document provides an overview of three essential Python libraries for scientific computing, data analysis, and visualization: **Pandas** and **Matplotlib**.

## Pandas
Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. Key features include:
- **Data Structures:**
  - **Series:** One-dimensional labeled data.
  - **DataFrame:** Two-dimensional labeled data, akin to a spreadsheet or SQL table.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing data, filtering, and transformation with ease.
- **Data Aggregation and Grouping:** Summarize data effectively.
- **File I/O:** Supports reading and writing from various file formats, including CSV, Excel, SQL, and JSON.

Pandas is widely used in data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis.

## Matplotlib
Matplotlib is a versatile plotting library for creating high-quality visualizations in Python. It supports:
- **Plot Types:** Line plots, bar charts, scatter plots, histograms, and more.
- **Customization:** Control every aspect of the figure, including labels, grids, and colors.
- **Interactivity:** Integrates with Jupyter Notebooks and supports interactive backends.
- **Extensions:** Works seamlessly with libraries like Seaborn for enhanced visualizations.

It is a go-to tool for visualizing data trends and patterns.
